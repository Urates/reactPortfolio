        <p>At a secondary level of my schooling I was not trained to be specifically in the commerce sector but I eventually ended up in the chartered accountancy stream of studies. This zoomed in many business concepts that would later help me in my entrepreneural journey.</p>

        <p>The initial goal was to become a Chartered Accountant at the time but as I grew older in the profession I realised just how much knowledge was idling in my mind waiting for conversion to wisdom. This opened up another door to a new career, entrepreneurship.</p>
